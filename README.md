## Post and browse realty listings

## Browse Listings
When opening the app, the landing page appears, where the user may swipe through suggested listings at the top, or click "Rent" or "Sale" buttons to view the respective listings.

## Profile
Creating a profile allows user to add their own listings to the site. Authentication is done with Google OAuth, and user data is managed with Firebase.
Start by creating an accoutn with email and password, or login with Google.

Once you select an offer, you can directly email the user who listed the property.

** This is a sample app I made to practice with React, Sirestore, Authentication, etc.., and add to my portfolio. The listings are not real offers.
